# OpenGL_Lesson
Learning to use OpenGL in Python; hopefully shaders training ground

Currently every .py script should be standalone example. Further down the road I will decide on one framework and separate library and initialization code.

Requirements include python-opengl, glut (should be available by default), pygame, cocos2d.

Texture files are licensed as free to private and commercial use from http://freestocktextures.com/ (selling and redistribution is not allowed)

Normal maps are created by me, do as you please with them.
